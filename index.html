<h2>My First Web Page</h2>
<p>bellow is my first attempt at java script</p>
<p></p>
<p>bellow is a example of innerHTML I am adding together 5 and 6 to make 11 but you can see the end result of that being 11 innerHTML works by assigning numbers or text to a already existing element</p>

<p id="maths"></p>

<script>
document.getElementById("maths").innerHTML = 8 + 3;
</script>


<p></p>
<p>next up is writing into the document directly this is a bit similar it works by directly writing into the document instead of needing any other code</p>

<script>
    document.write(3 + 8);
    </script>
