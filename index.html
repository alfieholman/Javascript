<h2>My First Web Page</h2>
<p>bellow is my first attempt at java script</p>
<p></p>
<p>bellow is a example of innerHTML I am adding together 5 and 6 to make 11 but you can see the end result of that being 11 innerHTML works by assigning numbers or text to a already existing element</p>

<p id="maths"></p>

<script>
document.getElementById("maths").innerHTML = 5 + 6;
</script>
